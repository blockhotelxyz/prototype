# Welcome the Block Hotel Prototype

The purpose of the Block Hotel Prototype is to demonstrate how hotels will be able to provision their nights to the marketplace. 

The process of provisioning is relatively straightforward and once in place should typically not change. 
The steps involved are: 

 1. Preparation of on chain Hotel Reference Data 
 2. Preparation of period calendar 
 3. Creation of Hotel Bearer Token Metadata
 4. Minting of Hotel Bearer Tokens 
 5. Provisioning (Allocation) of Hotel Bearer Tokens

## On chain Hotel Reference Data 
On chain Hotel reference data is crucial in ensuring the veracity and authenticity of Hotel Bearer Tokens. The point here is that the reference data is issued and maintained from known Hotel addresses. Thus customers can independently verify any Hotel Bearer Tokens purporting to have been issued by the Hotel. 

## Period Calendar 
The Period Calendar represents the calendar for the Hotel and the calendars for the individual rooms. 

## Hotel Bearer Token Metadata 
The Hotel Bearer Token Metadata is the basis of Hotel Bearer Tokens. It is stored off chain, with full details of the night that is offered by the hotel e.g. marketing material such as room photos, amenities etc. 

## Hotel Bearer Tokens
The Hotel Bearer Tokens are unique NFT based bonds issued by the Hotel. The Hotel commits to honouring in full the Hotel Bearer Token when it is presented by a Traveller / Guest. In the simplest form a guest staying multiple nights will present multiple tokens, one for each night. When presented to the Hotel, tokens are locked in the Hotel Contract and on check out the tokens are burned. 

## Provisioning 
To cater for sophisticated commercial arrangements that Hotels can sometimes be involved with, Hotels need to actively provision their Hotel Bearer Tokens to different marketplaces. This is so as to ensure that paper arrangements e.g. an existing arrangement with a commercial tour operator can be kept. In this instance the Hotel would issue an allocation of Hotel Bearer Tokens Directly to the commercial partner as payment is covered by the paper payment terms.
